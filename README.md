NFL Touchdown is probably the worst experience you will ever have in an american football game RPG.
The sole purpose for this game to exist is because i had to develop it for a "school" project.
ENJOY # American-Football-Game :P

Move the player left right up and down on the field
Try to avoid opponents otherwise you'll get injured!!
Score a touchdown for the glory!! 
As soon as you reach 10 points, you'll be NFL CHAMPION!!
